# JavaOS_Simulation
a simple operating system simulation written in Java, that applies the programming language mechanisms that support concurrency in Java. 

OS simulation allows multiple users to create, save, and print files, which are stored on multiple disks and printed to multiple printersâ€“all of which can be considered concurrent processes.
